# Laker

Is a project allowing huge amount of people (clients) to connect with expensive Data Lakes in order to download data to their local machines which will allow rapid prototyping of data driven algorithms and applications.

## The Goal

Laker was built and designed with one goal in mind: "to free up the data, which are otherwise sitting idle and just being covered in dust".
